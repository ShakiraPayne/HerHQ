                        Most women only wear a bikini a few weeks a year.

                        Tip one: <span className="font-bold">Rinse!</span> After you swim, immediately rinse your bikini or swimsuit in cold or lukewarm water to remove any harmful substances. <span className="font-bold">Tip two:</span> Check the care instructions on the label. Not all fabrics can be machine-washed. Regardless of what the label says, we always recommend washing swimwear <span className="font-bold">by hand</span>. Use cold or lukewarm water and a gentle detergent. Never leave your bikini or swimsuit to soak; you should rinse it immediately.

                        If you prefer to wash your lingerie or swimwear in the washing machine, that&rsquo;s fine.  <span className="font-bold">What&rsquo;s the best way to care for your swimwear?</span>
                        Just make a habit of it and be sure to follow these three important rules:
                        <br /><br />
                        <ul className="list-disc p-3">
                            <li>Choose the short program for delicate wash</li>
                            <li>Wash with cold or lukewarm water</li>
                            <li>Use a laundry bag</li>
                            <li>If your lingerie or swimwear has sequins, you should ideally wash it by hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span className="font-bold">Our final tip:</span> Never use fabric softener. It can affect the elasticity of the fabric.
